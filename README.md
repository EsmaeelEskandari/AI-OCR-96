# AI-OCR-96
Persian Character based OCR based on Deep Learning. Implemented using [Tensorflow]().

## Execute with English MNIST

  - The English verion of the code can be easily executed. The Tensorflow library will automatically download the MNIST dataset.
  - The entire code is self-contained and is only dependant on a single library, namely Tensorflow. 
  - The following parameters can be configured inside the code: 
  
```
learning_rate = 0.004
training_epochs = 30
batch_size = 100
```

The previous values are the ones proven to be the best and the most efficient based on our experiments. 

## Execute with Persian HODA dataset. 

> To be implemented.
